I found out about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a while ago. Previously, I was thinking of making a blog site and writing it all in html, css, etc like usual. But now that this exists, I don't have to waste my time on that and just focus on writing what I want. I quite like Hugo, although I have much to learn about it.

I also want to put my project showcases at the [projects page.](/projects)

I think this is it for the first post. I will see if I can enable Disqus comments on the site, just coz :) and also RSS since Hugo has that built-in.
